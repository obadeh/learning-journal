# What is a Text Editor?


*A text editor is program that allows you to open, view, and edit plain text files. Unlike word processors, text editors do not add formatting to text, instead focusing on editing functions for plain text.*

Text editors are used by a wide variety of people, for a wide variety of purposes. Software programmers and web developers use text editors to write and edit in programming and markup languages. This is one of the primary purposes of text editors, and many of the features of text editing software are built to help these users read and write code. However, text editors are ideal tools for anyone who needs to write quickly and simply, read source code, or create text files.


If you have Windows, you already have the default Notepad application installed on your system. Notepad is a very basic text editor with minimal features and low capabilities. If you only need a text editor for small tasks, Notepad will work just fine. However, Notepad's limitations become apparent if you try to do some more heavy duty text editing.

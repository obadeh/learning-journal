## Growth mindset

 Growth Mindset: “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point.

I keep remind myself in grouth mindset by:

1. Place effort before talent.
2. Reward actions, not traits.
3. View challenges as opportunities.

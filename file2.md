## What is HTML?


**HTML** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements are represented by tags
- HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
1. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

### Write HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit
 Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

 However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

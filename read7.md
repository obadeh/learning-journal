# Programming with JavaScript

* Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming . They will be covered in
three sections: *

- What is a script and how do I 
- How do computers fit in with 
- How do I write a script for a
create one? the world around them? web page?

Once you have learned the basics, the fo llowing chapters will show how the JavaScript
language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.



**A script** is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following:


1. RECIPES
By fo llowing the instructions in a
recipe, one-by-one in the order
set out, cooks can create a dish
they have never made before.


2. HANDBOOKS
Large companies often provide
handbooks for new employees
that contain procedures to fo llow
in certain situations.


3. MANUALS
Mechanics often refer to car
repair manuals when servicing
models they are not familiar
with. These manuals contain a
series of tests to check the key
functions of the car are working,
along with details of how to fix
any issues that arise.
